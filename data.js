      title: 'Bacon Burger',
      author: 'Jorge Relato',
      ingredients: [
        '3kg minced beef',
        '300g minced bacon',
        '1 egg',
        '3 tbsp plain flour',
        '3 tbsp homemade seasoning blend (garlic, salt, onion, pepper and parsley)',
        '30ml cold water'
      ],
      preparation: [
        'Mix the minced beef together in a bowl with the minced bacon, egg, plain flour and water.',
        'Season the meat with the homemade seasoning blend, then divide the mixture into portions of 90-100g and shape each one into a round pattie 2-2.5cm.',
        'Heat a frying pan or your barbecue and add the burgers - there is no need of oil, as some fat will render out of the meat. Cook for 4 minutes, or until the burgers are well seared and have a thick crust. Flip them and cook for another 3 minutes for rare meat, 4 minutes for medium-rare, 5 for medium and up to 6 for well done.'
      ],
      tips: "You can serve the burgers with cheese, lettuce, red onion, tomatoes, pickles and so on. If you want a cheesy topping, add it once you’ve flipped the burgers."

        '2 tsp salt',

        '250g grated mozzarela',
        '1 large handful basil leaves'
      ],
      preparation: [
        'To make the dough, place the flours, salt and yeast into a large bowl and stir. Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in the water along with the oive oil, gradually mixing in the flour to form a soft dough.',
        'Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and knead for 10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.',
        'Place it in a bowl and cover with damp tea towel and allow to prove in a warm place for 1–1½ hours.',
        'Remove the dough from the bowl and knead for a couple of minutes, then divide into two pieces. Roll out each piece to form a disc.',
        'Place a pizza stone or a baking tray into the oven to preheat.',
        'Blend the tinned tomatoes with a stick blender or a food processor. Spoon the blended tomato over the pizzas and scatter over the grated mozzarella.',
        'When ready to bake, slide the pizza directly onto the pizza stone and cook for 8–10 minutes.',
        'To serve, scatter the basil leaves over the pizza.'
      ],
      tips: 'San Marzano tomatoes have dense flesh and a rich, sweet flavour. They are considered by many chefs to make the best tomato sauce, but good quality plum tomatoes could be substituted.'

      ingredients: [
        '12 chicken wings',
        '2 tbsp plain flour',

      preparation: [
        'Mix the chicken wings together in a bowl with the plain flour.',
        'Pour the oil into a large saucepan or deep frying pan and set over a medium high heat. Place a thermometer in the oil and heat to 180C.',
        'When the oil has reached the right temperature, very carefully lower the chicken pieces into the oil.',
        'Serve it with the barbecue sauce.'
      ],
      tips: 'If you don’t have a thermometer, heat the oil on a medium heat, then test it with a piece of bread – it should take around 30 seconds to go a crisp brown – any quicker and the oil is too hot.'
